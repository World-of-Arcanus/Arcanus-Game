History
-------

This software was originally named Manic Digger, and it was placed into the public domain.

https://github.com/manicdigger/manicdigger
https://sourceforge.net/projects/manicdigger

As far as I can tell, development started in 2010 and ended in 2015 when the project was abandoned.

The original author's name/pseudonym is exe, and they occasionally post on the official website still.

http://manicdigger.sourceforge.net

I forked this code from the "develop" branch in their GitHub repository, 
and I have made substantial changes to bring the code up to modern standards.

My version is licensed under the open source ISC License.
